# HTML-codes

Link: https://neocities.org/site/vinewsdispatch

My HTML codes where during my Senior year in High school using Neocities website.
I recently updated it to take off my image of myself. My professor at the time
wanted us to plce our images or something and so I just did. At the time,
I did not know that publishing an image online in public will impact my privacy.
And so I decided to delete images to keep my privacy.

I apologize if the codes were cringy and chidlish. This was the start of my first coding in html.
I learned a lot wiht html. I didn't think it would make an impact, but just starting off with
the basics and using my creativity to make it fun!

Nowadays, I don't really use html, but sill understand it as other coding becoming more useful.

My other HTML projects that I will edit(privacy issues), I'll publish it here if I have time.
