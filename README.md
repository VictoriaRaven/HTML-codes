# HTML-codes

Link: https://neocities.org/site/vinewsdispatch

I learned my HTML codes during my senior year in High school using "Neocities" website.
This was the start of my first coding in html so it may be a bit youthful.
I learned a lot with html and I was starting off with the basics and using my creativity to make it fun.
Currently, I do not use HTML that often, but I can comprehend it as the other coding languages are userful in the mordern day.

My other HTML projects that I will edit(privacy issues), I'll publish it here if I have time.

Below here will have my other HTML usage on other sites:
I created a guitar tab using their HTML layout.
UltimateGuitarTabs: https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/one-ok-rock/last-dance-tabs-1772760

I have also done some apps during the same time period of 2018 for HTML. It was an app on Thunkable.

Thanks.
