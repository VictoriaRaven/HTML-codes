# HTML-codes

Link: https://neocities.org/site/vinewsdispatch

I learned my HTML codes during my senior year in High school using "Neocities" website.
I recently updated it only to take off my image of myself. My professor at the time
wanted us to place our images so I did. At the time,
I did not know that publishing an image online in public will impact my privacy.
And so I decided to delete images to keep my privacy.

I apologize if the codes were cringy and chidlish. This was the start of my first coding in html!
I learned a lot with html. I didn't think it would make an impact, but just starting off with
the basics and using my creativity to make it fun!

Nowadays, I don't really use html, but I still understand it as other coding languages becomes more useful.

My other HTML projects that I will edit(privacy issues), I'll publish it here if I have time.


Below here will have my other HTML usage on other sites:
I created a guitar tab using their HTML layout.
